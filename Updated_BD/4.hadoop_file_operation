Step 2: Create a File in HDFS

Use -touchz to create an empty file:

hadoop fs -touchz /1.txt


Check file in NameNode UI → Utilities → Browse the file.

Step 3: Create a Directory in HDFS
hadoop fs -mkdir /BigDataLab

Step 4: Create a Sub-Directory
hadoop fs -mkdir /BigDataLab/EX2


Refresh NameNode UI → Sub-directory EX2 appears inside /BigDataLab.

Step 5: Create Files in Sub-Directory
hadoop fs -touchz /BigDataLab/EX2/file4.txt
hadoop fs -touchz /BigDataLab/EX2/file5.txt

Step 6: Delete Files from HDFS
hadoop fs -rm /BigDataLab/EX2/file4.txt
hadoop fs -rm /BigDataLab/EX2/file5.txt


Output:

Deleted /BigDataLab/EX2/file4.txt
Deleted /BigDataLab/EX2/file5.txt

Step 7: Delete a Directory
hadoop fs -rm -r /BigDataLab/EX2


Output:

Deleted /BigDataLab/EX2

Step 8: Delete Another File
hadoop fs -rm /1.pdf


Output:

Deleted /1.pdf

Step 9: View Files / Directories in HDFS
hadoop fs -ls /
hadoop fs -ls /BigDataLab

Step 10: Stop Hadoop Services
stop-yarn.sh
stop-dfs.sh
