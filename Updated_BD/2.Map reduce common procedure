Step 1 — Create / prepare the input file

Open Notepad (or any text editor).

Type the input data required by your program (one record per line).

Example (matrix combined input):

A 0 0 1
A 0 1 2
...
B 2 1 12


Save the file as input.txt (choose ANSI or UTF-8 encoding). Put it in C:\Users\HP\Desktop\bd (example).

Step 2 — Create mapper and reducer scripts

Create mapper.py and reducer.py in the same folder.

Both scripts must read from standard input (sys.stdin) and write to standard output (print()).

Save them with .py extension.

Note: On Windows you do not need executable permission or chmod. Use python mapper.py to run.

Step 3 — Open the correct shell and change directory

Open Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.

Navigate to the directory:

cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\bd

Step 4 — Quick test: check Python and files

Check Python:

python --version


List files to confirm:

dir
# or in PowerShell:
Get-ChildItem

Step 5 — Test mapper alone (debug)

Send input to mapper and view output:

type input.txt | python mapper.py


(or PowerShell)

Get-Content input.txt | python mapper.py


If mapper works you’ll see key-value lines (e.g., 0,0\tA,0,1).

Step 6 — Test full pipeline (mapper → sort → reducer)

CMD (recommended):

type input.txt | python mapper.py | sort | python reducer.py
